## Analysis    

Further analysis could be performed based on the queries implemented

A possibility would be Get_Star_Radius function which gets the radius of a star or even better Get_Stars_above_radius which would first get all star radii and compare it to the given input and return the stars which have a radius greater than the input.  
Getting all stars greater than the average radius of all stars is another possibility.

Finding the number of planets in a given orbit range around a given star which could potentially use a query to get all planets below and above certain thresholds.
